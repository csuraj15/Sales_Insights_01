# Sales_Insights_01

# Sales data has been fetched from an online source.

The Data we have used to draw the insights belong to a company named atliQ hardware
The data is stored and maintained in a mySQL database.
We need to have mySQL server, Connector, workbench and shell installed on the PC.
We can open the database and check the server status and we can run a few scripts to get some overview of the data we're dealing with.
To perform data analysis we have used Power BI
We have connected the database and extracted the required data to work with.
Established relationships between the various tables, as part of Data Modeling.
The data we have is compatible to an approach called star schema,
Sales transactions act as the fact table and remaining tables namely products, customers, markets, date are dimensional.
We carry out ETL operations in Power Query Editor and we use DAX to write formulae in Power BI.
We can use filters in power query or run scripts in mySQL, to cross check our results effectiveness and performance.
Create new measures to get the insights from our Data
Using various widgets to get the visualisations show very useful insights to make data driven decisions

#version 2 of database had extra information like profits, cost price

The possibilites are infinite with a single database
